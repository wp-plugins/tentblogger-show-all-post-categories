Tired of scrolling to find all your categories for that blog post? Use this to show all your blog post categories at the same time. Easy mode.

This plugin does one very simple thing and yet can change the way you blog by saving you tons of time: It shows all your categories in the blog post editing screen in WordPress. No more scrolling to find that missing category! This is especially helpful if you've got a number of sub-categories as well.

Nothing to setup - just install, activate, and go.
